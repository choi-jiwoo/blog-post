### Reality

- Predicting asset prices is very challenging
- Extremely competitive
- Predictions are very weak
- Inefficiencies disappear
  - alpha decay
- Markets are non-stationary over time
- Markets are heterogenous across markets/asset classes
- Available data decreases with trade time horizon

> **Cannot rely on data alone! Need to combine with structural views/insights on how markets work**

### AI / ML in Investing: Reality

- Mature industry
- Top players have been around 10+ years
- There will be no ‘singularity’
- **Instead through careful engineering we will see incremental improvements**

### Data Sources

Inefficiencies/data sources for return prediction
- Microstructure effects
- Price history
- Cross-sectional price history
- Analyst ratings, sentiment
- Fundamental data
- News
- …

General shift to novel data sources beyond traditional data
- Alternative data
  - social media
  - satellite imagery
  - credit card transactions

### Models / Algorithms
General shift to more complex “black box” methods

> Many independent predictive models need to be combined

**Current challenges**

- How to combine predictions? (“alpha-mixing”)
- How to manage correlation when developing models?
- How to manage over-fitting when developing models?

### Large Scale Compute

Large scale compute resources increasingly at the forefront in ML

> Large scale compute resources are likely to be a significant cost (and competitive advantage) going forward in quant investing

### Increasing Returns to Scale

- Large fixed costs for technical/computational infrastructure
- Need to exceed transaction costs to profitably trade
  - Incremental predictive models are increasingly valuable
- Need to develop many predictive models in a coordinated way
